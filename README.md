# Project Name: Damping Modelling in Dynamic Systems by using Fractional Derivative 
# Description of the  project
1.	Fractional Derivative damping model is applied in-place of viscous damping to study damping characteristics of dynamic system.
2.	Fractional Damping model is solved using difference method and wrote MATLAB program for the same. 
3.	Analyzed the free and forced vibration response of the system. Studied the difference between the viscous damping and fractional derivative damping. 
4.	Found out power-law decay characteristics for free vibrations response and derived mathematical relation for finding fractional order of the system from forced vibration   response.
